# Build On Base Boilerplate (BoBB)

Simple, minimalistic and opinionated [Next.js] + Foundry boilerplate to start developing on Base.

This boilerplate is designed to be used to develop DApps using Foundry, Next JS, Anvil, [RainbowKit] and Rivet. This means you will test against a local forked Base node.

## Requirements

- [NVM]
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry)
- [Alchemi provider](https://www.alchemy.com/)
- [Wallet connect id](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/sign-in)

*Note: Since it is free and only takes a few minutes, we recommend getting a projectId from WalletConnect Cloud.

The project consist of 2 packages:

- [Next](./packages/next) - Next.js 14.0.2, with App router
