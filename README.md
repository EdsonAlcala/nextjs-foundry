# Build On Base Boilerplate (BoBB)

Simple, minimalistic and opinionated [Next.js] + [Foundry] boilerplate to start developing Onchain Apps on Base.

This boilerplate is designed to work with the following stack:

- [Foundry]
- [Next.js] - Next.js 14.0.2, with App router
- [Anvil]
- [RainbowKit]
- [Op-Wagmi]

## Features

- Automatic react hook generation
- Wallet integration
- Next.JS app router integration

## Requirements

- [NVM]
- [Yarn]
- [Foundry]
- [Alchemy provider]
- [Wallet connect id]

*Note: Since WalletConnect requires a projectId and it is free and easy to get, we recommend getting a projectId from WalletConnect Cloud.

## Architecture ðŸ“¦

The project consist of 2 packages:

- [App](./packages/app) - Next.js 14.0.2, with App router
- [Foundry](./packages/foundry/) - Smart contract project

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/edsonalcala/dapp-boilerplate

$ nvm use

$ yarn
```

2. Start Anvil by running:

```bash
yarn chain
```

3. On a second terminal, deploy the smart contracts contract to the local `Anvil` instance by running:

```bash
yarn deploy
```

4. On a new terminal, start the NextJS app by running:

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Roadmap

[ ] Add deploy to vercel button

[ ] Add support for op-wagmi

[ ] Integrate [React hot toast] or [React toastify]
