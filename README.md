# Build On Base Boilerplate (BoBB)

Simple, minimalistic and opinionated [Next.js] + Foundry boilerplate to start developing on Base.

This boilerplate is designed to be used to develop DApps using Foundry, Next JS, Anvil, [RainbowKit] and Rivet. This means you will test against a local forked Base node.

## Requirements

- [NVM]
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry)
- [Alchemi provider](https://www.alchemy.com/)
- **[Wallet connect id](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/sign-in)

*Note: Since it is free and only takes a few minutes, we recommend getting a projectId from WalletConnect Cloud.

## Architecture ðŸ“¦

The project consist of 2 packages:

- [Next](./packages/next) - Next.js 14.0.2, with App router
- [Foundry](./packages/foundry/) - Foundry project

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/edsonalcala/base-boilerplate

$ nvm use

$ yarn
```

2. Start Anvil by running:

```bash
yarn chain
```

3. On a second terminal, deploy the smart contracts contract to the local `Anvil` instance by running:

```bash
yarn deploy
```

4. On a new terminal, start the NextJS app by running:

```bash
yarn start
```
